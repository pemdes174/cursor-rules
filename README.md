# My Cursor Rules for Vibe Coding in 2025 🚀

Hey, I'm Ryan Wang, ex-FAANG engineer currently building [Daxtr.ai](https://daxtr.ai). These rules help me one-shot features with minimal bugs and rework.

## 📁 What's Included

- **Next.js Development Rules** - Complete patterns for modern, scalable apps
  - Next.js 15+, React 19, TypeScript, Vitest, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
  - App Router patterns, tRPC integration, authentication, database best practices
- **Unit Testing Rules** - Simple, focused testing that actually prevents regressions
  - Isolation, determinism, and practical testing patterns

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanrawlingswang/cursor-rules.git
cp -r cursor-rules/.cursor/rules/ ~/your-project/.cursor/
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

Battle-tested from building enterprise SaaS platforms and working at scale (Amazon, Atlassian). These rules help me one-shot features with minimal bugs and rework. They strike the right balance between:
- **Speed** - Get features done quickly without cutting corners
- **Quality** - Production-ready code that doesn't need major refactoring  
- **Maintainability** - Clear patterns that make future changes predictable
- **Developer Experience** - Fun to work with, not a chore

## 🎨 Key Benefits

- **One-Shot Features** - Implement most features correctly on the first try
- **TypeScript-First** - Strict typing catches issues early (learned from Amazon's massive codebases)
- **Testing That Actually Helps** - Focused tests that prevent regressions without being a burden
- **Performance Built-In** - App Router patterns that scale without optimization headaches
- **Security Without Friction** - Authentication patterns that work out of the box

## 🤝 Sharing

This is my personal setup, but I'm happy to share! Feel free to fork and adapt these rules to your own style.

*P.S. If you're building something cool with these rules, I'd love to hear about it! And if you need help building something bigger, feel free to [email me](mailto:ryan@stratussoftworks.dev).*

**Happy vibe coding! 🚀**
